## Design Process

Our design philosophy draws inspiration from the aesthetics of Princess Polly, a renowned Australian clothing brand known for its chic and stylish online presence. Embracing the elegance of their black and white themed website, we've infused this sophisticated palette into our own site, deriving color accents from product images. This deliberate choice ensures that our customers' attention is directed towards our showcased products, creating a visually pleasing and cohesive user experience.

To complement the bold and edgy nature of our clothing line, we've opted for big and bold fonts. This design choice not only aligns seamlessly with the essence of our products but also adds a touch of confidence to the overall look and feel of our website. Our goal is to create an environment where the design resonates with the boldness and uniqueness of the fashion pieces we offer.

In a delightful contrast to our bold aesthetic, we introduce cute mini-games. These games serve as charming elements that appeal specifically to our target audience: female teens. By blending the bold and edgy with the cute and playful, we aim to create a dynamic and engaging online space. We believe this harmonious blend will captivate our customers, encouraging repeated visits as they appreciate the unique juxtaposition that defines our brand.
